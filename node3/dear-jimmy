Dear Jimmy,

I screwed up. Really.

You weren't suppose to notice that this box is compromised.

But guess what, you screwed up too. Really. I suppose you thought I wouldn't
notice that you noticed.

And don't even think about trying to email Mr. Scott. Who do you think
instated the policies that made your box compromised? Let's face it. You're
a world's better than Mr. Scott at anything related to security.

But wait, there's more. Here's your account information:

 CHEQUING
 ... $5920.72

 SAVINGS
 ... $12032.28

Wouldn't it be a shame if it all... disappeared? Tell anyone else about this,
and guess what'll happen. And no, they don't have backups.

Sincerely,
"J".
