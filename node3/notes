Suspicious activity on this box
-------------------------------

email -- to be sent if things get really out of hand only

Dear Mr. Scott,

It has come to my attention that my box may potentially be compromised.
Firstly, I seem to have been locked out of root access. Secondly, upon
investigation of the contents of my .bash_history, I see many commands
that I do not remember executing.

Please investigate.

Best Regards,
Jim Hendricks
Regional IT Director

notes --

 - locked out of root
 - strange entries in .bash_history
 - something about shellshock
 - found .anonymous file in home directory, contained a cryptic message
   needs key? or virus... deleted promptly.
 - no strange activity since sept. 2

precautions taken --
 - wiped box... nothing's here now
 - took secret key down... phew, CEO would be mad if I leaked it
