To the contrary, the new security policy is secure precisely because it is so
complicated. As a trained security expert, I assure you that the most advanced
form of security is <strong>security by obscurity</strong>. Hash functions can
be broken, encryption can be circumvented, but secrets can never be leaked.

When designing the new policy, I took into account the following principles:
* mitigate the risk of code injection vulnerabilities
* mitigate the risk of race conditions
* make accessible to all employees, but prevent any single employee from leaking
  all secrets.

With that in mind, there are several highlights of the new security policy that
I would like to discuss... with <em>all</em> our employees.

Firstly, our esteemed CEO Bertrand is at the centre of our security protections.
His files can only be accessed through a security key that only he knows. But
there is of course the risk of an event where the CEO is unable to act. Luckily,
in the new policy, with the collaboration of 5 of 8 members of the board of
directors, the CEO's key can be retreived. The mathematics behind this secret
sharing is far too complicated and secret to discuss in an employee mailing list.

Secondly, as you are aware, our new website is under construction. Previously,
the website (the one you are on right now) was segregated from our internal
infrastructure for "security" purposes. However, it is widely known that this
segregation is only an increased cost for marginal benefit. Therefore, the new
website is intimately connected with our internal network. This is a good thing;
it will enable us to make a much more powerful employee's interface.

Cheers,
