      <p>Your friend, Jameson, works at the multinational corporation The North Bank.
        He alleges that the CEO has done despicable things, including accepting
        bribes and falsifying financial documents. Your challenge, should you choose
        to accept it, is to hack the North Bank to find evidence of these heinous
        crimes.</p>
      <p>Before you go, read Jameson's email.</p>
      <pre>Dear Friend,

Rumour has it that our CEO has committed fraud and taken bribes. There's no evidence
though. Can you pwn the company website and find that evidence?

Here are my employee credentials:

username: jameson
password: hunter72

By the way, I saw an admin once and he got a more advanced employee area. See if
you can get into that one. I think it'll help.

You can log in <a href="bank.php">here</a>. Thanks!</pre>
