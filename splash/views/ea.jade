      p.
        Wes has asked me to show this <a href="mail/isn.html">notice</a>. As is
        usual for Wes I don't understand it, but here it is anyways.

        Hi, I see that you are an Admin user. Wes has asked me to provide the IP
        address for the new website here. It's 104.131.92.247.

      p.
        Also, if you got a key like me, apparently we're supposed to recombine
        them <a href="~wscott/keys">here</a>... but only if the CEO isn't available?
        Dont worry I don't get it&nbsp;&nbsp;Either.
