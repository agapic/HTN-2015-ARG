If you're snooping around in this folder, you're
either Wesley (myself) or an intruder. If the latter
is true, get lost.

New security policy means that our keys can be combined
to get Bert's secret. Until the security of these
servers is proven in practice keys should be stored on
the old webserver, here:

http://104.236.74.251/~wscott/secret

Key is protected with a passphrase. The passphrase is
not stored in plaintext for security purposes. Instead
it is hashed with /usr/local/bin/securehash. Of course
secure hash is chosen because it is far more secure than
broken hash functions such as MD5.

Oh, and if you're an intruder: securehash is not related
to NIST's "SHA ('Secure' Hash Algorithm)" which is of
course not secure at all. securehash is my own invention
and nobody has broken it at all yet, so you can leave now.
